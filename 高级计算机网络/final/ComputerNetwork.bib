However, as an emerging field of study, edge computing is still in its infancy and faces many challenges in its implementation and standardization. In this article, we study an implementation of edge computing, which exploits transparent computing to build scalable IoT platforms. Specifically, we first propose a transparent computing based IoT architecture, and clearly identify its advantages and associated challenges. Then, we present a case study to clearly show how to build scalable lightweight wearables with the proposed architecture. Some future directions are finally pointed out to foster continued research efforts.},

	abstract = {Smart home applications are ubiquitous and have gained popularity due to the overwhelming use of Internet of Things (IoT)-based technology. The revolution in technologies has made homes more convenient, efficient, and even more secure. The need for advancement in smart home technology is necessary due to the scarcity of intelligent home applications that cater to several aspects of the home simultaneously, i.e., automation, security, safety, and reducing energy consumption using less bandwidth, computation, and cost. Our research work provides a solution to these problems by deploying a smart home automation system with the applications mentioned above over a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi (RPI) device. The RPI is used as a central controlling unit, which provides a cost-effective platform for interconnecting a variety of devices and various sensors in a home via the Internet. We propose a cost-effective integrated system for smart home based on IoT and Edge-Computing paradigm. The proposed system provides remote and automatic control to home appliances, ensuring security and safety. Additionally, the proposed solution uses the edge-computing paradigm to store sensitive data in a local cloud to preserve the customer’s privacy. Moreover, visual and scalar sensor-generated data are processed and held over edge device (RPI) to reduce bandwidth, computation, and storage cost. In the comparison with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed system is 5\% faster in detecting motion, and 5 ms and 4 ms in switching relay on and off, respectively. It is also 6\% more efficient than the existing solutions with respect to energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Smart devices along with sensors are gaining in popularity with the promise of making life easier for the owner. As the number of sensors in an Internet of Things (IoT) system grows, a question arises as to whether the transmission between the sensors and the IoT devices is reliable and whether the user receives alerts correctly and in a timely manner. Increased deployment of IoT devices with sensors increases possible safety risks. It is IoT devices that are often misused to create Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which is due to the weak security of IoT devices against misuse. The article looks at the issue from the opposite point of view, when the target of a DDoS attack are IoT devices in a smart home environment. The article examines how IoT devices and the entire smart home will behave if they become victims of a DDoS attack aimed at the smart home from the outside. The question of security was asked in terms of whether a legitimate user can continue to control and receive information from IoT sensors, which is available during normal operation of the smart home. The case study was done both from the point of view of the attack on the central units managing the IoT sensors directly, as well as on the smart-home personal assistant systems, with which the user can control the IoT sensors. The article presents experimental results for individual attacks performed in the case study and demonstrates the resistance of real IoT sensors against DDoS attack. The main novelty of the article is that the implementation of a personal assistant into the smart home environment increases the resistance of the user’s communication with the sensors. This study is a pilot testing the selected sensor sample to show behavior of smart home under DDoS attack.},

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) fundamentally improves the user's experience when interacting with the virtual world, and could revolutionarily transform designs of many interactive systems. To provide VR from untethered mobile devices, a viable solution is to remotely render VR frames from the edge cloud, but encounters challenges from the limited computation and communication capacities of the edge cloud when serving multiple mobile VR users at the same time. In this paper, we envision the key reason of such challenges as the ignorance of redundancy across VR frames being rendered, and aim to fundamentally remove this performance constraint on highly dynamic VR applications by adaptively reusing the redundant VR frames being rendered for different VR users. Such redundancy in each frame is decided at run-time by the edge cloud, which is then able to memoize the previous results of VR frame rendering for future reuse by other users. After a VR frame is generated, the edge cloud further reuses its redundant pixels compared with other frames, and only transmits the distinct portion of this frame to mobile devices. We have implemented our design over Android OS and Unity VR application engine, and demonstrated that our design can efficiently reduce the computation burden at the edge cloud by more than 90\%, and reduce more than 95\% of the VR frame data being transmitted to mobile devices.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing market penetration, today's high-end virtual reality (VR) systems remain tethered, which not only limits users' VR experience but also creates a safety hazard. In this paper, we perform a systematic design study of the “elephant in the room” facing the VR industry - is it feasible to enable high-quality VR apps on untethered mobile devices such as smartphones? Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g., 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, and view-based bitrate adaptation we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14 ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).},
